# UniCore

**UniCore** is a lightweight architectural foundation for Unity, providing decoupled signals, scoped global variables, and powerful runtime debugging tools.

It helps structure large projects with clear data flow, explicit state management, and zero-allocation runtime paths — without the overhead of a full framework.
