# UniSignal
UniSignal is a zero-allocation, interface-driven event system for Unity, built for high-performance gameplay, clear debugging, and scalable architecture.  It features flag-based event scopes, priority-aware listeners, automatic lifecycle handling, and powerful debugging tools — without delegates, reflection, or hidden GC costs.
